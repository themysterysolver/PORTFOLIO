## NOTES:
----
#### How to make everything align center vertivally?
- `d-flex` is `display:flex`
- we make the columns flexible than row which is by default,`flex-column`
-  `align-items-center` and `text-center` makes everything to center and `align` works with ***vertical*** things.

---
- `<p>` is a block level elment.
- `.img-fluid` sclaes properly on all size screens!
#### fetch()
- It is a *js function* that makes **HTTP req** to fecth a *file or API*
- It returns a ***promise** that is it doens't return `data` immediately but **waits for file to load**.
- `.then()` recieves the *response*
- `resposne.json()` also returns a ***promise*** so we use anothe `.then()` to handle data.
